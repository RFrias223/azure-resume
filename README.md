My first cloud project (Build an Azure Resume, following ACG video https://youtu.be/ieYrBWmkfno?si=tgxKyNxyuxc8gDof)
# Setting up Environment
This project requires the following: 

GitHub and Azure account.

When setting up my environment I encountered multiple challenges as it's my first cloud project.
